### Full-Stack Developer | Blockchain & Web3 Enthusiast | Software Engineer

---

🚀 **Turning Code into Impact** – As a full-stack developer with a focus on **blockchain** and **Web3** solutions, I specialize in building secure, scalable applications that push the boundaries of the digital experience. My journey spans everything from **React-driven user interfaces** to **Solana smart contracts** and **decentralized apps (dApps)**, making sure projects don't just work, but truly stand out.

## 💼 About My Work

Most of my professional work is in **private repositories** due to the sensitive nature of blockchain contracts, proprietary projects, and security-focused applications. However, you can explore some of my live projects below that showcase my skill set:

- **[Symlix](https://symlix.com)** - A marketplace powered by blockchain technology for secure peer-to-peer trading.
- **[Solhub.io](https://solhub.io)** - A decentralized hub for Solana-based tools and resources.
- **[TheProteinCompany](https://theproteincompany.pk)** - E-commerce site for fitness enthusiasts.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in learning more about my private projects or to discuss a custom project!
